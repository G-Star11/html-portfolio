<h1>The Best Movies According to Gary</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Number 1. Pump up the Volume</h3>
    <p>Watched as a teenager.  Very influential to be a rebel against the system and use technology to outwit
    to the establishment to bring about change for the good</p>
<h3>Number 2. The Basketball Diaries</h3>
    <p>Watched in late teens.  Influential to show the power of how good drugs can be at the ultimate cost - your life.
    Lesson - as great as drugs can be...  Don't do drugs kids</p>
<h3>Number 3. Trainspotting</h3>
    <p>A great "party" movie to show the joy of the different personalities of your friends and to love them for who they are</p>
<h3>Number 4. The Power of One</h3>
    <p>Watched around 10 to 13 years old.  Very impressionable movie on how corrupt the world is and how we must stand up to make
    the world a better place</p>
<h3>Number 5. The Bourne Identity</h3>
    <p>Classic Mystery Action Thriller with the undertones of the secret government agencies and world controllers</p>

<h3>Number 9. Moana</h3>
